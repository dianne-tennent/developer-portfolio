                <h3>The classic To Do List</h3>
                <p>This was a solo full stack project I worked on during Enspiral Dev Academy. It's a great way to practice managing state in redux, along with database queries and applying conditional classes in CSS.

            <h3>RANK - an app for finding the nearest public toilet, and ranking it!</h3>
            <p>This was our final group project at Dev Academy. I had an awesome time working with my team and we were all really proud of the end result.</p>
            <p>I mainly worked on the back end setting up the server, database interactions and API requests, as well as implementing authentication. I got the chance to learn a bit about interactive maps and was very stoked about getting the star rating CSS to reflect the rating stored in our database for each toilet review.

                <h3>Madlibs - a game for exploring English grammar</h3>
                <p>I wanted to make this app because I'd often used Madlibs as a way to reinforce learning parts of speech in the classroom, but it would always be a hassle to print out a bunch of pages and the stories to choose from were fairly limited.</p>
                <p>With this app, you can add custom text to use as a Madlib, so teachers and students can either select or write their own stories to use.
